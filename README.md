# Day 01 Take Home Challenge

Branch D01H

## Assignment

Create an empty GitHub repository (without a README)
and clone the repository to your computer. Inside the
empty repository, initialize a new React application
using the create-react-app command. Inside the src/
folder, create a file called utils.js. Copy the
functions from your In Class Challenge into utils.js
and export the functions so they can be imported and
used in other files. (Make sure to delete your API
key for now so you don’t commit it to GitHub. We’ll
fix this later.)

Launch the development server using the npm run start
command to confirm that the boilerplate app works.
Commit your changes and push them to your GitHub
repository.
