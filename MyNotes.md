Homework for BitWise React Class

These are my notes on doing this homework. The notes include items not clear in the code itself, including what I have done with GitHub and Terminal, such as cloning and loading npm, react, etc.

## Branch Structure

The plan for this homework repository is to create a branch for each assignment. The main branch
will remain as the original React App, which can be branched for different projects.

## GitHub Setup

I created a new repository on GitHub, with the following specifications:
- No Template
- Name: react-homework
- Description: Homework for BitWise React Class
- Public
- Add a README file

The name cannot contain upper case letters, to comply with something I don't remember. It may be a requirement of React.

The README file is added so that the repository is not empty. This is needed so that the clone function will work correctly.

## Cloning the Repo

I used VSCode to clone the repo. I used the HTPPS connection.

After cloning, I deleted the README.md file. The React installation will create a new README.md file.

## Installing React

At the terminal:  
npx create-react-app react-homework

Note: "npm install" will use the package.json file and install all dependencies required. This is useful when cloning someone else's application from GitHub, where the dependencies are not included.

## My Notes

After installing npm, I created MyNotes.md (this file). It will contain notes not included in
README.md

## Stellar Store

This is a branch of main, which means I don't need to reinstall react.

## Install Additional React Components

At the terminal:  
npm install react-router-dom  
npm install styled-components
